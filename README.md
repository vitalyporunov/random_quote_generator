Assignment 3 
The Random Quote Generator is an interactive web application that dynamically displays random quotes from a collection of motivational, inspiring, and famous sayings. Built with Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this web application allows users to view random quotes, share them on social media, and submit their own quotes. The design is responsive, modern, and incorporates engaging animations for improved user experience. The project is developed without using a database, utilizing local data structures instead. 
Key Features:
Random Quote Display: Users can generate a random quote with a single click.
Submit Quotes: Users can submit their own quotes through a form, which are then displayed temporarily.
Favorites Section: Users can mark quotes as favorites and view them in a separate section.
Responsive Design: The website adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
Animations: Quotes fade in and out smoothly, enhancing the overall aesthetic.
